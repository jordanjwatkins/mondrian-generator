#Mondrian Generator

**Randomly Generates A Visual Based on the Art of Piet Mondrian**

I was inspired by day four of Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://jenniferdewalt.com/) to learn more about Piet Mondrian and to see if I could write code to randomly generate pieces that emulate his style.

This code was also used as the level generator for my game [Mondrals](http://jordanjwatkins.github.io/mondrals).
